			"list_dns_routes truncates long domain lists: use get_dns_route or explain_route before telling the user a domain is not routed. " +
			"add_server_peer creates working VPN credentials and get_server_peer_config returns a client's private key: call them only when the user asked, and hand the config to them rather than repeating it elsewhere. " +
